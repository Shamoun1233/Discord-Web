    <h2>What is Discord?</h2>
    <p>Discord is a free, all-in-one communication platform designed for creating communities, sharing content, and connecting with others in real-time. Originally built for gamers, Discord has expanded to serve a wide range of audiences, including hobbyists, educators, businesses, and general social groups. It offers features such as text chat, voice calls, video calls, and screen sharing, all in a seamless and user-friendly interface.</p>
    <p>At its core, Discord allows users to create <strong>servers</strong> — private or public spaces where groups can interact. Within these servers, you can organize channels by topic or activity, whether it’s for chatting, gaming, learning, or working. This makes it an ideal tool for group communication and collaboration.</p>
    <p>Discord is more than just a communication tool; it’s a platform for building and maintaining online communities, whether for games, learning, projects, or just for socializing with like-minded people. Since its launch in 2015, Discord has grown exponentially and remains a favorite among users of all ages.</p>
