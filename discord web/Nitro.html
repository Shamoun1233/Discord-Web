                What is Discord Nitro?

                Discord Nitro is a premium subscription service offered by Discord that enhances your experience on the platform. 
                With Nitro, users get 
                access to a wide range of features that are not available with the free version of Discord. These include:
                Custom Emojis & Animated Emojis: Use custom emojis from any server youâ€™re part of and even create your own! Plus, 
                enjoy animated emojis for extra flair in your messages.
                Increased File Upload Limit: Nitro users can upload files up to 100MB, compared to the 8MB limit for 
                free users.
                Server Boosts: Get 2 Server Boosts with Nitro, which improve the quality of your 
                favorite servers (better audio quality, more emoji slots, and more).
                Higher Quality Video: Enjoy HD video quality during screen sharing and video calls.
                Name Tag Customization: Change your Discord tag number to make it unique and easily identifiable.
                Other Cool Perks: Nitro members also get access to exclusive badges, a special Nitro profile banner, and more.
