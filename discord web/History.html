### **The History of Discord**

**Introduction to Discord:**
Discord is a popular communication platform that has become the go-to service for voice, video, and text communication, especially for gamers, communities, and various other groups. Its journey to success is an inspiring story of innovation, overcoming obstacles, and becoming a cultural phenomenon.

### **Early Beginnings (2015)**

Discord was founded in 2015 by Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy, two former gamers who were frustrated by the lack of a reliable communication tool for gaming. Before Discord, players often used a variety of apps for voice communication, with many complaints about lag, poor quality, and cumbersome setups. Jason Citron had already founded a gaming company, *OpenFeint*, which was sold to *GREE* in 2011. After that, Citron and Vishnevskiy decided to build a better communication tool for the gaming community.

The first version of Discord launched on **May 13, 2015**. The platform aimed to simplify voice communication while providing a seamless, easy-to-use, and high-quality experience for gamers. Discord was built from the ground up to address the needs of online gamers—especially in terms of reducing latency, ensuring high-quality audio, and offering a simple user interface.

### **Early Success and Rapid Growth (2015-2016)**

Upon launch, Discord quickly gained traction, especially among gamers, thanks to its excellent voice quality and ease of use. Unlike other communication platforms, Discord was free to use, which allowed it to attract a large user base. By the end of **2015**, Discord had already attracted over **1 million** users. 

The platform was designed with gamers in mind, featuring a streamlined user experience, group chat, and support for in-game overlays. In just a few months, Discord became the go-to platform for players to organize and communicate during online games.

### **Expansion Beyond Gaming (2016-2018)**

Although Discord initially catered to gamers, the platform’s features and potential quickly attracted a broader audience. By **2016**, Discord began evolving from a gaming-centric tool into a broader communication platform that could be used for communities of all types—whether for education, business, hobbyist groups, or even casual social interactions.

In **2017**, Discord introduced a series of new features, including **video chat**, **screen sharing**, and **direct messages**. This opened up the platform to even more use cases, such as virtual hangouts, business meetings, and more. Additionally, Discord introduced custom **servers** for users to create and manage their communities, each with its own channels for different topics.

### **Monetization and Premium Features (2017-2019)**

Discord began introducing premium features in **2017**, starting with **Discord Nitro**, a subscription service offering users additional benefits such as enhanced server functionality, custom emojis, and higher quality voice chat. This helped Discord monetize its platform while still keeping the core features free for users.

The introduction of **Discord Nitro** helped the platform scale further, as it was able to generate revenue while still offering a free, open space for communication. As a result, Discord continued its rapid growth, reaching **250 million users** by **2019**.

### **Becoming the Go-To Platform for Communities (2018-Present)**

By **2018**, Discord had established itself as more than just a gaming tool.

The ability to create custom servers with specific rules and organization tools was one of Discord's standout features, making it incredibly flexible for a wide variety of use cases.

Discord also introduced features like **Threads**, allowing for more organized conversations within a channel, and **Discord Bots**, which could automate tasks, moderate servers, and add fun features to communities.

### **Discord’s Role During the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-Present)**

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 accelerated the use of digital communication tools, including Discord. As people were forced to stay home and rely on remote communication, Discord became a lifeline for many who wanted to connect with friends, colleagues, and family. It became a popular platform for virtual events, study groups, social gatherings, and even professional meetings.

Discord’s **server boosts**, allowing users to upgrade servers for added benefits like better voice quality and additional customization options, helped the platform maintain and even grow its user base during the pandemic. During this period, Discord saw a huge surge in user activity, with over **100 million monthly active users** by the end of **2020**.

### **Acquisitions, Partnerships, and Future Outlook**

It has been at the forefront of shaping online communication, blending gaming with socialization, professional collaboration, and virtual events.
